<h1>9-1-17 Chapter 2</h1>
<p><b>Matter</b>: anything that takes up space and has mass</p>
<p><b>Energy</b>:has no mass and does not take up space; the ability to do work or to put matter into motion</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kinetic</b>: when energy is actually doing work (moving objects)</li>
<li><b>Potential</b>: when energy is inactive or stored</li>
</ul>
<p>* Energy cannot be created nor destroyed; only changed from one form to another</p>
<h3>Forms of energy:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Chemical</b>: stored in the bonds of chemical substances</li>
<li><b>Electrical</b>: movement of charged particles</li>
<li><b>Mechanical</b>: energy that is <i>directly</i> involved in moving matter</li>
<li><b>Radiant</b>: travels in waves</li>
</ul>
<p>In any conversion of energy, we lose some energy to heat.</p>
<p>In the body, chemical energy of foods is trapped in the bonds of a high-energy chemical called <b>ATP (adenosine triphosphate)</b>.</p>
