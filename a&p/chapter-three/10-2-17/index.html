<ol>
	<li>A cell is the basic structural and functional unit of living organisms</li>
	<li>The activity of an organism depends on the collective activities of its cells</li>
	<li>According to the <i>principle of complementarity</i>, the biochemical activities of cells are dictated by their structure (anatomy), which determines their function (physiology)</li>
	<li>Continuity of life has a cellular basis</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, a cell has three main regions or parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Nucleus</li>
	<li>Cytoplasm</li>
	<li>Plasma membrane</li>
