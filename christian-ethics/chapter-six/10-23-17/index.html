<h1>10-23-17 - Chapter 6</h1>
<h2>The Image of God</h2>
<p>We are created in God's image and have the capacity to relate to God on a personal level and to each other.</p>
<p>We are unique in this and gives us value. We should not murder other humans.</p>
<p>This is foundation of the sanctity of human life. God reaffirmed our sanctity through His Son.</p>
<h2>Old Testament Texts</h2>
<p>In the context of <i>laws given through Moses</i> about several <i>immoral practices</i>, God warned his people, "You shall not give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech" (Lev. 18:21)</p>
<p>Many nations surround Israel practiced <i>child sacrifice</i>. The influence of those nations led <i>Solomon</i> to cede to their religious practices, including child sacrifice.</p>
<p><i>Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel</i> condemned hte practice.</p>
<p>The <i>ethics of abortion</i> should be determined in this context. The OT always forbade abortion, child sacrifice, etc.</p>
