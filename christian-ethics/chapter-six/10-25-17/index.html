<h1>10-25-17 - Chapter 6</h1>
<h2>Early Christian Writings</h2>
<p>Against the bleak backdrop of Romans culture, the <i>Hebrew "sanctity of human life" ethic provided the moral framework for early Christian</i> condemnation of abortion and infanticide...</p>
<p><i>Didache</i> 2.2 (c. A.D. 85-110): "Thou shalt not murder a child by abortion nor kill them when born"</p>
<p>The silence of the NT itself on abortion is probably due to the fact that it was <i>simply assumed to be beyond contemplation</i> for Christians</p>
<p>Luke,though, indicates <i>fetal personhood</i> when he writes that <i>the unborn John the Baptist "leaped for joy"</i> in his mother's womb when Elizabeth came into the presence of Mary, who was pregnant with Jesus at the time (Luke 1:44)</p>
<p>More than merely condemning abortion and infanticide, early Christians provided <i>alternatives</i> by <i>rescuing and adopting</i> abandoned children.</p>
