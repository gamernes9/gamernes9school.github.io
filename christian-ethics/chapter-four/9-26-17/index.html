<h1>9-26-17 - Chapter 4</h1>
<h2>Are we trying to "play God"?</h2>
<p>Some Christians recommend <b>prudence</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Tower of Babel</i>: attempt to be equal to God...<i>suspicion</i> of human wisdom (Prov. 16:18)</li>
	<li><i>Medical errors</i> that have resulted from trying to <i>reach beyond our knowledge</i></li>
	<li><i>Two spheres</i>: In one, <i>humans</i> understand and control, and have proven wisdom...in the other, everything is beyond human control; there <i>God</i> works...Humans should not invade God's territory; if one attempts something previously beyond human control, they seem to be "playing God"</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Christians are more <i>adventurous</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>Gen 1:26-28 and 2:19: God charged humans to "<i>rule over</i>" the rest of creation and collaborate</li>
	<li>We should take <i>initiative</i>, use our <i>abilities</i> to solve problems (Mat 25:14-30)</li>
	<li>Opportunities in medicine are <i>God's invitation</i> to advance; God works through human effort</li>
	<li>Extreme form: do <i>anything</i> we're able to do</li>
	<li>(<u>Problem</u>: just because we can, doesn't mean we should; also, gifts come from God and should serve God's purpose, not ours)</li>
</ul>
