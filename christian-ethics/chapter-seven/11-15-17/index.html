		<p>A couple living together has nearly everything marriage has to offer (including SEX!), but few commitments or responsibilities.</p>
	<h3>Cohabitation and Perceptions</h3>
		<p>A ten-fold increase in cohabitation in the past few years is staggering. A combination of factors, including few taboos against pre-marital sex, early sexual maturity,later marriage, and adequate income to live away from their families. Unfortunately, they are more likely to divorce, less happy, and score lower on well-being indices (including SEXUAL SATISFACTION).</p>
	<h3>The Consequences of Cohabitation</h3>
		<p>Cohabitation can be harmful to marriages, as well as couples and children. In a study based on family and marriages, they found that marriages with previously cohabitants were 46% more likely to divorce than non-cohabitants.</p>
	<h3>Cohabitation and the Bible</h3>
		<p>The Bible teaches that the act of SEXUAL INTERCOURSE makes two people feel bonded with each other. When done within the bounds of marriage, the man and the women become one flesh. But outside the marriage, it has consequences. When you do it with a USDP regulated LEGAL prostitute, you become a USDP regulated LEGAL prostitue in one flesh.
