<h2>Cultural Relativism</h2>
<p>In today's world we don't have to travel to observe differences between cultures.</p>
<p>If there's no accepted "transcendent" ethical standard, culture often becomes the norm for determining right and wrong.</p>
<p>"Cultural relativism" maintains that <i>truth, ethical norms, decisions, and actions are relative to a specific culture</i>...there's <i>no ultimate standard</i>.</p>
<p><i>What's wrong with this perspective?</i></p>
<h3><u>John Dewey's perspective</u></h3>
<p>Just as <i>language forms</i> grammatically, then <i>adapts</i> to changing circumstances of culture, <i>ethics</i> result from a culture's <i>organizing moral principles</i>, and then <i>change</i> with the culture.</p>
<p><i>Different forms</i> evolve in each community.</p>
<p>So, there are <i>no universal ethical principles</i>.</p>
<p><u>William Sumner</u> expanded this view: <i>Culture</i> is the <i>sole determinant</i> of ethical standards; culture alone determines what is right and wrong.</p>
<p>It is, indeed, obvious that different cultures come to <i>different conclusions/results/worldviews</i>...</p>
<p><i>However</i>, proponents of <i>cultural relativism</i> propose that this <i>diversity proves that culture alone is responsible</i> for moral concepts and practives, and that there is <i>no soul or spirit or conscience</i></p>
<p>Culture relativism argues <i>against judging</i> the moral practices of another culture.</p>
<p>However, this is a <i>logically self-defeating</i> argument...</p>
<p>Further, most would <i>condemn</i> any society's practices such as ethnic cleansing, but cultural relativism is <i>no basis</i> for morality.</p>
<p>Cultural relativism fits all too well with the dominant <i>postmodern</i> mentality of contemporary western societies...</p>
<h3>Postmodern philosophy maintains...</h3>
<ul>
<li>Truth is <i>not absolute</i></li>
<li>Truth is <i>created, not discovered</i></li>
<li>Truths created by one culture is <i>equally valid</i> as "truths" in another, even if they logically contradict</li>
<li>Norms are equally valid if there are useful within the given culture (<i>utilitarian</i>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Utilitarianism</h2>
<p>The default standard for decision-making for many people</p>
<p>"The <i>greatest good</i> for the <i>greatest number</i>"</p>
<p>The sole standard of morality is the <i>usefulness of things, actions, and people</i></p>
