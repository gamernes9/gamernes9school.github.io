<h1>9-21-17 Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>Managing difficult issues</h2>
<p>Christians <i>may disagree</i> over some issues (<u>Rom. 14:1-2</u>; 1 Cor. 8:1-13)</p>
<p>The <i>primary goal</i> for Christians in everything: <u>glorify God</u> (1. Cor. 10:31)...within those parameters, there is <i>liberty on some issues</i></p>
<p>A Christian should avoid what could offend one's own <i>conscience</i>...some things, though morally neutral, could be obstacles in one's personal relationship with God or others (1. Cor. 6:12)</p>
<p>The emphasis of all of James's letter: <i>conduct that demonstrates authentic faith</i></p>
<p>He does not teach "faith in works", rather "<i>a faith that works</i>"</p>
<h2>NT ethics: Conclusion</h2>
<p>No NT writer gives a systematic summary of ethics...rather they provide principles</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Writing to Philemon, Paul doesn't attack the to the institution of slavery, rather he contributes to revolutionizing the thinking of Christians.</li>
<li>In Colossians 4:1, he warned owners of their responsibility to their slaves, and in 3:22, spoke to slaves as responsible toward God</li>
<li>In Philemon, he presented Onesimus as a Christian brother, instead of a slave...when an owner can think of a slave as a brother, the legal designation of "slave" will no longer have significance</li>
<li>Paul first connected Philemon and Onesimus in Christian love in such a way that emancipation would become necessary...exposed to the light of the gospel, the institution of slavery would have to shrivel and die.</li>
</ul>
