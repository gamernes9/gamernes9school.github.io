<h1>9-18-17 Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>Jesus and the Law</h2>
<p>Jesus often indicated the <i>original purpose of God's demands</i> (as opposed to the Jews' misinterpretations), e.g. the Sermon on the Mount (Mat. 5-7)</p>
<p>When interpreting the law, he gave a more <i>radical interpretation</i>...righteousness was about an internal condition, not mere external actions (Mat. 5:20)</p>
<p>He dealt primarily with <i>moral law</i> and not ceremonial law...He didn't totally reject ceremony and tradition (Mt. 17:24-27), but did when they didn't represent God's will.</p>
<h2>Jesus' teaching: <i>hyperbole</i></h2>
<p>Characteristic of many of Jesus' statements, sometimes causing difficulty for interpretation, it was <i>exaggeration for effect</i> (e.g. <u>Mt. 5:29-30</u>)</p>
<h2>Ethics and New Life in Jesus</h2>
<p>The works that Jesus demands of his disciples are the <i>fruits of an internal transformation</i> - or <i>new life in him</i>, brought about by the <i>regeneration</i> and continuing activity of the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, which begins with repentance and commitment to him personally (John 3; Mark 1:15, 17)</p>
<h1>The Ethics of Jesus in John's writings</h1>
<h2>Principles in John's letters</h2>
<p>Ethical teaching is more dominant in John's letters than in his gospel</p>
<p>Emphasis on correct attitude and action:</p>
<p>The <u>correct attitude</u> is <i>love demonstrated by compassion</i>...</p>
<p>The <u>correct action</u> is <i>righteousness consisting of obedience to God's commands</i>...</p>
<p><u>Righteousness</u> is the <i>result of being born of God</i> (<u>1 John 2:28-29</u>; <u>2 John 5-6</u>)</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation is <i>prophecy</i> that intends to <i>change the conduct</i> of its readers (Rev. 1:3), through <i>warnings</i> and <i>exhortations</i> (2:7, 11, 17, 29, 3:6, 13, 22)</p>
<h1>The Ethics of Paul</h1>
<h2>Apostle to the Gentiles</h2>
<p>Paul wrote to <i>gentile converts from paganism</i> who had <i>no knowledge of the Old Testament</i></p>
<p>They lived <i>surrounded by much immorality</i>, confronting tremendous temptations</p>
<h2>Ethical Principles of Paul</h2>
<p><i>Love</i> is the primary moral principle (Gal. 5:14; 2 Cor. 5:14-15)</p>
<p>But Paul did not deny the <i>law's value</i>...he warned against any expression of <i>Christian liberty</i> that would promote <i>sin and disobedience</i> (Rom. 7:12; Gal 5:13-15)</p>
<p><i>Ethical living</i> is seen in terms of our <i>relationship to Christ</i>...Paul uses the phrases "<i>in Christ</i>" and "<i>in the Spirit</i>" in reference to the sphere in which we live (<u>Gal. 2:20</u>)</p>
<p>Paul gives <i>positive instructions</i> for conduct in family life, work, etc. (1 Thes. 4:1-12)...also, <i>examples of sins</i> that believers should avoid (Gal. 5:19-21)</p>
