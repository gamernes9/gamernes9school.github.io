<h1>9-14-17 Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>Methods of doing NT ethics</h2>
<p>The entire Bible as a book of <b>laws or commandments for controlling conduct</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Indeed, Jesus' ethical teaching was given with the force of commandments and <i>not merely suggestions</i></li>
	<li>This method's limitation is that it <i>doesn't produce morally committed persons</i>, but individuals who struggle to control the worst of immoral conduct</li>
	<li>Although this method can help in the area of personal morality, it doesn't give sufficient direction in the area of social morality</li>
