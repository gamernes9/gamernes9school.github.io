<h1>9-14-17 Chapter 3</h1>
<h2>Methods of doing NT ethics</h2>
<p>The entire Bible as a book of <b>laws or commandments for controlling conduct</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Indeed, Jesus' ethical teaching was given with the force of commandments and <i>not merely suggestions</i></li>
	<li>This method's limitation is that it <i>doesn't produce morally committed persons</i>, but individuals who struggle to control the worst of immoral conduct</li>
	<li>Although this method can help in the area of personal morality, it doesn't give sufficient direction in the area of social morality</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bible <i>merely</i> as a <b>collection of moral principles</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Permits flexibility in the relevant application of Scripture for today</li>
	<li>However, it makes Jesus look like a mere philosopher who spoke about various moral issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Making decisions as an "encounter" with God through the <b>Holy Spirit</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>It's good to affirm the Holy Spirit's role in guiding the believer, but it's dangerous to make decisions in only a subjective manner</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering circumstances to determine a "<b>loving response</b>"</p>
<ul>
	<li>Indeed, the law of love should be applied in every situation</li>
	<li>However, a limitation is that "love" can become mere sentiment, variously defined by individuals, and used to tolerate whatever kind of conduct</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Each of these methods contains an element of truth that should be utilized in an adequate approach</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>The 1st method emphasizes that God has provided an <i>authoritative source</i> for guidance</li>
	<li>The 2nd affirms that the Bible provides <i>principles</i> instead of narrowly applied rules</li>
	<li>The 3rd affirms that the <i>Holy Spirit</i>'s role is indispensable for living an ethical life</li>
	<li>The 4th emphasizes the importance of the <i>motive of love</i> in a life that pleases God</li>
</ul>
