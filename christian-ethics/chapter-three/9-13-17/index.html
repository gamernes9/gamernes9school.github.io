<title>9-13-17 Chapter 3</title>
<h1>9-13-17 Chapter 3</h1>
<p>The <i>Gospels</i> convey Jesus' teaching to his followers - much of that has to do with relationships with others, based on their relationship with him and his Father</p>
<ul>
	<li>His "sermon on the mount" gives examples of ethical <i>principles that exceed what the law</i> demanded ("<i>You have heard it said...but I say to you...</i>"), with emphasis on a person's <i>internal/spiritual condition</i>.</li>
	<li>Such a high ethical expectation is possible due to the fact that <i>Jesus perfectly fulfilled</i> with the law and the prophets</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the <i>NT letters</i> deals with ethical conduct of believers, individually and as the body of Christ, in relationship to each other and with those outside the church</p>
<p><i>Overall</i>, there is <i>continuity</i> between the OT and NT, for from Gen 1:1 to Rev. 22:21 it is God's story - the history of God's activity to reveal himself to us and draw us to himself.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a significant difference, in regards to ethics and obedience, between the <i>Old Covenant</i> (based primarily on the <i>law</i> which served as the "terms" of the covenant) and the <i>New</i> (based primarily on a personal <i>relationship with Christ</i>, through the <i>work of His Spirit in us</i>).</p>
<h1>Supplemental Material</h1>
<h2>Methods of studying OT Ethics</h2>
<p>Some do a <i>sociological analysis</i> of the variety of conduct described in the OT...however, the OT sees God's fidelity as the basis of right conduct.</p>
<p>Others consider that the Old Testament faith is derived from the <i>covenant</i> with God and led to moral norms...ethical conduct was part of the covenant obligation.</p>
<h2>Methods of approaching the OT</h2>
<p>As a <b>book of rules</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>List of rules or laws; <i>ethics consists of obeying them</i></li>
	<li>Supposed examples: A Christian shouldn't rob or murder; demands "an eye for an eye"; treats slaves according to OT laws on slavery</li>
	<li><i>Problems</i> with this perspective...
	<ul>
		<li>Ignores difference between OT times and today, as well as NT times</li>
		<li>Discounts much of the OT that doesn't consist of laws</li>
		<li>Treats the OT as a book of rules replaced by Jesus and the NT</li>
		<li>Suggests that the OT is a book of laws that persons follow to merit salvation, in contrast with the gospel</li>
		<li>Denies true relevance of the OT for Christian ethics</li>
		<li>Was not Jesus' view of the law (Mat. 5:17)</li>
		<li>Sum: doesn't provide a good basis to understand OT ethics for the Christian community</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>As a <b>book of principles</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Similar to first method, but seeks principles based on the commandment...</li>
	<li>Example: Commandment against murder (Ex. 20:13) has a basis in the principle of respect for human life, and the principle is applied in various situations in the Christian life</li>
	<li>Sometimes an OT historical account could follow and affirm principles, such as justice and loyalty in relationships (e.g., story of David and Jonathan)</li>
	<li>This is the preferred method (see previous info about principles)</li>
	<li>However, it's necessary to use a <i>correct</i> "<i>hermeneutic</i>" (guidelines for biblical interpretation), which recognizes and uses the <i>historical/cultural context</i>, along with the <i>literary context</i>, to discern the <i>universal principle</i> (<i>eternal truth</i>) in the biblical passage, and then make <i>appropriate application</i> of the principle to our contemporary context.</li>
