<h1>9-13-17 Chapter 3</h1>
<p>The <i>Gospels</i> convey Jesus' teaching to his followers - much of that has to do with relationships with others, based on their relationship with him and his Father</p>
<ul>
	<li>His "sermon on the mount" gives examples of ethical <i>principles that exceed what the law</i> demanded ("<i>You have heard it said...but I say to you...</i>"), with emphasis on a person's <i>internal/spiritual condition</i>.</li>
	<li>Such a high ethical expectation is possible due to the fact that <i>Jesus perfectly fulfilled</i> with the law and the prophets</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the <i>NT letters</i> deals with ethical conduct of believers, individually and as the body of Christ, in relationship to each other and with those outside the church</p>
<p><i>Overall</i>, there is <i>continuity</i> between the OT and NT, for from Gen 1:1 to Rev. 22:21 it is God's story - the history of God's activity to reveal himself to us and draw us to himself
