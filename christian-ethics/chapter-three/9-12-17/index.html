<h1>9-12-17 Chapter 3</h1>
<p>God reveals himself through our <i>conscience</i> (<u>Rom. 2:12-16</u>) - as we are created in his image (<u>Gen. 1:26-27</u>) - "<i>Natural Revelation</i>"</p>
<p>God reveals himself through his <i>spoken and written word</i> (<u>Psalm 19:7-11</u>; Psalm 119; <u>2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21</u>) - "<i>Special Revelation</i>"</p>
<p>God has revelaed himself ultimately through his Son, <i>Jesus Christ</i>, the incarnate and Living Word (<i>Heb. 1:1-3</i>) - "<i>Special Revelation</i>"</p>
<p>Why is this foundation - God's self-revelation - necessary for Christian ethics?
<p><i>God's revealed nature</i> is the <i>ultimate, absolute, and sole standard of right and wrong</i> (<u>Isaiah 6:1-9; Rom. 3:23</u>)</p>
<p>So, as we consider ethical issues in our contemporary culture, we take into account historical - philosophical perspectives, but the <i>Bible is always our primary source and guide</i></p>
<ul>
<li>"See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than <i>according to Christ</i>" (i.e., anything against the gospel) (<u>Col. 2:8)</u></li>
</ul>
<p>What's the most basic principle for Christian ethics?</p>
<p>Love God, and love your neighbor as yourself</p>
<p>What do you think a "principle" is when we're talking about scripture?</p>
<p>A <i>biblical truth</i> which can be <i>applied universally</i> (to all people, anywhere, at any time)</p>
<p>Most of the Old Testament consists of the story of <i>God's dealings with Israel</i>, based on his <i>covenant</i> with them (Ex. 24)</p>
<p>OT ethics are expressed especially (but not exclusively) in the form of <i>legal codes</i> by which God have direction for <i>social conduct</i> on many levels.</p>
<p>OT law is usually divided into 3 major categories: <i>ceremonial, civil, and moral</i></p>
