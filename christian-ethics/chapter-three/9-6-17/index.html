<h1>9-6-17 Chapter 3</h1>
<p>This is a "<i>teleological</i>" system, telos meaning "end" or "goal"...Morality is determined by <i>end result</i>..."<i>The end justifies the means</i>"</p>
<p>(<i>Biblical</i> ethics is based on <i>law/principles</i> and on a <i>relationship</i>: God as Creator and Redeemer).</p>
<h3>Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed system on idea of <i>pleasure</i>, based on ancient <i>hedonism</i>, which pursued physical pleasure and avoided pain</li>
<li>"Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, <i>pain</i> and <i>pleasure</i>...they govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think..."</li>
</ul>
<h3>John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed on Bentham's system, but added a "<i>qualitative</i> element, suggesting that some pleasures were of higher quality than others</li>
<li>Proposed that <i>rules</i> could be developed based on what has produced the <i>best consequence for the most people in the past</i>...(but ultimately focus on results demolishes the rules)</li>
</ul>
<h3><i>Significant weakness of Utilitarianism</i></h3>
<ul>
<li>Remains, in spite of attempts to "quantify", very <i>subjective</i> and <i>based more on emotion</i> than logic and consistent principles</li>
<li>Offers <i>no protection for the minority</i></li>
<li>Predicting the ends or consequences is based on <i>guesswork</i></li>
</ul>
<h2>Situation Ethics</h2>
<p>A <i>form of utilitarianism</i>, first proposed by <i>Joseph Fletcher</i> (1905-1991), who modified the pleasure principle and called it the <i>agape (love) principle</i>...but it was still the same utilitarianism</p>
<p>The law of love requires the greatest love for the greatest number of people in the long run</p>
<p>Tried to find alternatives to extremes of legalism and antinomianism</p>
<p>Misinterpreted and misapplied <i>biblical passages</i> to support his ideas (e.g. <u>Matthew 22:37-40</u>)...missed or ignored <u>Matthew 5:17-19</u></p>
