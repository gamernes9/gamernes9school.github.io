<h2><i>Why is Christian Ethics important?</i></h2>
<p>We make <i>ethical decisions</i> every day.</p>
<p>We confront <i>ethical issues</i> in society.</p>
<p>We live in a "postmodern" world where <i>values are inverted</i>: "...evil is called good and good is called evil" (Isaiah 5:20)</p>
<p>"The theory of relativity is considered an absolute norm and biblical absolutes are considered relative."</p>
<h2><i>To clarify the issues</i></h2>
<p>We must deal with issues on the basis of our character and values...One task of Christian ethics is <u>formation of character</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li>What factors lead a person to a decision?</li>
<li>How do we calculate factors such as where a person is born and grows up?</li>
<li>Who are a person's models or heroes?</li>
<li>What exercises authority in one's life?</li>
<li>How has one managed experiences of pain?</li>
<li>How has the person experienced and managed power or influence?</li>
<li>How has the person experienced blessing in life?</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals express their perspective on the Christian life in different ways</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Thou shalt not...</i>" A basic level of ethical reflection: there are things that Christians must not do</li>
<li>"<i>Thou shalt...</i>" More positive, but still places primary responsibility for decisions outside of the person</li>
<li>"<i>I must...</i>" Sees personal responsibility ind decisions; but still has a strong orientation of duty...There's no joy in decisions</li>
<li>"<i>I'll do it/I won't do it</i>" Recognizes positive and negative imperatives in the Christian life - a sense of duty, but also joy and hope in the decision</li>
<li>"<i>I am...</i>" The image that Paul gives: "the perfect man" -  a mature person in Christ</li>
</ul>
<h2><i>To define our values</i></h2>
<p><i>Values influence decisions</i>...Life consists of a series of choices based on our values.</p>
<p>We live in time of <i>moral crisis and confusion</i>...Without examining our values, we're formed by going from one crisis to another.</p>
<p>We face...</p>
<ul>
<li>Moral dilemmas from modern technologies</li>
<li>Family crisis</li>
<li>Life style issues</li>
<li>Personal identity crisis</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps for ethical decision-making</h2>
<p><b>Pray</b>: for God's wisdom, at the beginning and throughout the process (<u>James 1:5</u>)</p>
<p><b>Study the situation</b>: Gather, assess, and understand relevant information.</p>
<p><b>Study the Bible</b>: Look for principles that apply to the situation (more on that in chapter 4).</p>
<p><b>Study the people involved</b>: Consider character, motives, values, background, relationships, and more that may influence your decision.</p>
<p><b>Remember the goal</b>: The glory of God and the good of others are twin goals that we want to achieve.</p>
<p><b>Seek wisdom</b>: Continue where you began, seeking God's wisdom..Wisdom comes from the skill and experience of combining these factors to apply Biblical teaching to life's situations (<u>James 1:2-8</u>)</p>
<p>Good decisions and good moral conduct involve...</p>
<ul>
<li>Good ends/results</li>
<li>Good motives, desires, and attitudes</li>
<li>Good means (methods and actions taken)</li>
</ul>
