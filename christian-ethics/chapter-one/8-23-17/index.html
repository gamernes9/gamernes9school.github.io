<h2><i>Why is Christian Ethics important?</i></h2>
<p>We make <i>ethical decisions</i> every day.</p>
<p>We confront <i>ethical issues</i> in society.</p>
<p>We live in a "postmodern" world where <i>values are inverted</i>: "...evil is called good and good is called evil" (Isaiah 5:20)</p>
<p>"The theory of relativity is considered an absolute norm and biblical absolutes are considered relative."</p>
<h2><i>To clarify the issues</i></h2>
<p>We must deal with issues on the basis of our character and values...One task of Christian ethics is <u>formation of character</u>.</p>

<li>What exercises authority in one's life?</li>
<li>How has one managed experiences of pain?</li>
<li>How has the person experienced and managed power or influence?</li>
