<h3>Survey says...</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most "practicing Christians" in America - defined as those who attend church regularly and say that their faith is important to them - hold to elements of non-Christian worldviews. Only 17% look at the world through a predominantly Biblical perspective.</li>
<p>(<i>Barna survey article, May 2017</i>)</p>
<li>61% hold to elements of "New Spirituality," i.e., New Age, Eastern, or Neo-Pagan beliefs (such as all religions being one; the karmic view that if we do good we receive good, and vice versa).</li>
<li>54% have postmodernist views that truth and morality are relative.</li>
<li>36% hold to Marxist views, such as the evils of private property and the desirability of government control.</li>
<li>29% agree with secularism, on materialism, and science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many Christians <i>don't act</i> like Christians because they <i>don't think</i> like Christians. <i>Why?</i></p>
<p><u>Problem:</u> lack of <i>accurate biblical teaching</i> that provides framework of biblical worldview...<i>How can that be? Answer:</i></p>
<p>Survey indicates that <i>only half of protestant/evangelical pastors</i> have a solid biblical worldview.</p>
<h2>Absolute truth</h2>
<p>Biblical ethics rests on the belief in <i>absolute truth</i>...<i>What's that?</i></p>
<p>However, many professing Christians accept the <i>prevalent attitude</i> of our society that truth is <i>relative</i> to the person and the situation, choosing which laws of God to accept.</p>
<p>The dominant culture bases moral choices on whatever will bring the most pleasing or satisfying results for the individual.</p>
<h2>Christian commitment</h2>
<p><i>Faith commitment</i> affects one's perspective on <i>moral issues</i>...but the effect isn't as strong as it should be.</p>
<p>Most adults say they're <i>concerned</i> about the moral condition of our nation, but a large % holds to views that <i>conflict</i> with the moral teaching of their professed faith.</p>
<p><i>How do most Christians in America see themselves in American culture?</i></p>
<p>Many Christians think of themselves as <i>individuals</i> first, then <i>Americans</i>, and as <i>Christians</i> third.</p>
<p>More <i>recently</i> there are indications of a <i>reverse</i> trend: there is a wider <i>disparity</i>, but teens and young adults who are committed Christians, are <i>strongly committed</i>.
<h2>Ethics and education</h2>
<p>Ethics may be taught in public schools; but teachers avoid discussing ethical issues and usually teach that ethics are relative, situational, individual.</p>
<p>Ethics must be based on something more concrete than personal preference.</p>
<p>We face difficult moral issues which need analysis based on an ethical system that provides clear and consistent direction.</p>
