<h2><i>What is Christian Ethics?</i></h2>
<p>God gives us specific <i>instructions</i> about how he wants us to <i>conduct</i> our lives </p>
<ul>
<li><i>including</i> commands, laws, moral standards, ideals, prohibitions, and principles</li>
<li>concerning moral <i>accountability & judgment</i>, rewards & punishments</li>
<li>in order <i>to please God</i> by applying the <i>holiness of God</i> to human life (<i><u>Lev. 11:44-45; 19:2; 20:7; 1 Peter 1:14-16</u></i>)</li>
</ul>
<h2><i>Brief Overview of Biblical Ethics</i></h2>
<p>The first example of ethical instruction in the Bible: God gave <u>Adam & Eve</u> commands
<ul>
<li><i>Positively</i>. "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it..." (Gen. 1:28).</li>
<li><i>Negatively</i>. "from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat" (Gen. 1:27)</li>
</ul>
<p>Later God gave Israel the <i>foundation</i> of his law in the <u>Ten Commandments</u> (Ex. 20) then added more detailed laws in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers & Deuteronomy - proscribing and prohibiting certain actions, as well as teaching right attitudes: "<i>You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and with all your might. These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart</i>" (Deut. 6:5-6)</p>
<p>The Bible teaches about moral living through <u>narrative</u> (examples of what pleases and displeases God), <u>wisdom literature</u> (examples of good judgment), and <u>prophecy</u> (God's call to repent from sin and indications of consequences of repenting of sin and continuing in sin).</p>
<p><u>Jesus</u> came & lived a life of <i>perfect obedience</i> to his Father.</p>
<ul>
<li>"I do nothing on My own initiative, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me. And HE who sent ME is with ME; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him" (John 8:28-29).</li>
<li>"Jesus the Son of God...has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin" (Heb. 4:14-15).</li>
</ul>
<h2><i>Faith & Obedience</i></h2>
<p><u>Justification</u>, or pardon & acceptance with God, comes to people through <u>faith</u> in Christ alone, who gave himself on the cross to make possible our pardon by God's <u>grace</u> alone: "by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, lest any man should boast"</p>
<h2><i>God's Holiness as His Moral Standard</i></h2>
<p>God is constantly and consistently true to his own nature.</p>
<p>His moral standard is always consistent with his nature and character (in general: <i><u>1 Peter 1:15; 1 John 4:19; Luke 6:36; Eph. 5:1</u></i>)...More specific commandments and laws also follow from and reflect his character.</p>
<p>Anything contrary to God's character is sin, or rebellion against God.</p>
<p>God actively opposes, constantly & consistently, all sin or evil.</p>
