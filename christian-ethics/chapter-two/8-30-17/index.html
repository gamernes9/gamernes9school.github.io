<h3>Thomas Aquinas (ca. 1224 - 1274)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Systematized Latin (Roman) theology</li>
<li>Faced challenges of <i>scientific rationalism</i>, <i>technology</i>, <i>and progress</i>, along with changing perspectives</li>
<li>Maintained that <i>social institutions</i> could encourage the development of "good people"</li>
<li>Maintained that the purpose of the law was to mold good people, not merely restrain evil</li>
<li>Distinguished between <i>four kinds of law</i>:
<ul>
<li><u>Eternal law</u> - Divine Reason governs the whole community (physical laws such as gravity)</li>
<li><u>Natural law</u> - good is to be done and evil, avoided; principles which are considered to be self-evident</li>
<li><u>Human law</u> - civil and criminal laws that govern communities</li>
<li><u>Divine law</u> - God's special plans for humanity, revealed through the Bible</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>David Hume (1711 - 1776)</h3>
<ul>
<li><u>Empiricism</u>: theories should be based only on what is perceived through senses</li>
<li>Hume took it to logical extreme of <i>radical skepticism</i>, maintaining that our <i>knowledge</i> is only a series of <i>sensations & can't be certain</i></li>
<li>Proposed that <i>morality</i> is only a matter of <i>sense impressions</i>, or mental perceptions</li>
<li>Argued that morality should be judged by its <i>usefulness/utility</i> (utilitarianism)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804)</h3>
<ul>
<li>At height of the Enlightenment, proposed an ethical system in which <i>reason</i> is the <i>final authority for morality</i></li>
<li>Only objects of <i>experience</i> (phenomena) may be known; objects beyond our experience (noumena) are unknowable</li>
<li>Actions must be from sense of <i>duty dictated by reason</i></li>
