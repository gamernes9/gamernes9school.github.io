<h3>Plato (ca. 428 - 346 B.C.)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Student of Socrates, teacher of Aristotle</li>
<li>Taught a theory of knowledge (epistemology), a theory of conduct (ethics), a theory of government (political science), a theory of universe (cosmology)</li>

<li>The <i>state</i> should have unlimited authority</li>
<li>No private property</li> 
<li>No <i>family</i> institutions...children belong to the state and should be educated by state-appointed officials, according to ability</li>
<li><b>Contrast with Christian ethics</b>: Plato is...<i>man-centered</i>...<ul>
<li>Right and wrong is judged by <i>whatever</i> was reasonable to the <i>individual</i>...action judged ethical if a <i>rational justification</i> was provided</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Aristotle (384 - 322 B.C.)</h3>

<li><i>Chief goal</i> of life: goodness or happiness, which comes from "self-realization"</li>
<li>Assumed <i>goodness</i> of human beings</li>
<li>Classical Greek philosophy maintained that <i>reason</i> would guide people to be <i>good</i> and live in <i>peace</i></li>
<li><b>Contrast with Christian ethics</b>:<ul>
<li>Bible teaches that highest goal is to <i>know</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>obey God</i></li>
<li>Bible teaches that human beings are "<i>created in God's image</i>" and <i>capable of love</i>; but both Bible and experience/history teach that humans are inclined to and do <i>rebel</i> against God</li></ul></li></ul>
